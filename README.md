# Pro MERN Stack 2nd Edition book project

This is my repository for the project described in the book Pro MERN Stack (2nd Ed) by Vasan Subramanian.

## Chapter 3

In this chapter, I started to use React classes to instantiate components. I laid out the main page of the Issue Tracker  by generating components dynamically from data and composing them together. I also learned how to pass data from a parent component to its children, which allows us to reuse a component class and to make it to render differently with different data.

### notes

- React Classes
  - React classes are used to create real components.
  - React classes are created by extending `React.Component`. Within the body, at least a `render()` method is needed, otherwise the component will have no screen presence.
  - The `render()` function is supposed to return an element, which can be either a native HTML element such as a `<div>` or an instance of another React component.
  - React classes can be instantiated by `<[class-name] />`.
- Composing Components
  - Component composition allows the UI to be split into smaller independent pieces so that each piece can be coded in isolation and can be reused easily.
  - React’s philosophy prefers component composition in preference to inheritance.
- Passing Data Using Properties
  - A component takes inputs (called properties), so we can pass different data from a parent component to a child component and make it render differently on different instances.
  - The easiest way to pass data to child components is using an attribute when instantiating a component. Within the `render()` method of the child, the attribute’s value can be accessed via `this.props.[atrribute]`, where `props` is a special object variable.
  - In most cases, the name of the attribute is the same as the HTML attribute. To avoid conflicts, there are some different naming requirements, like `class` in HTML -> `className` in JSX, hyphen-based-names in HTML-> camelCasedNames in JSX.
  - For the `style` attribute, rather than a CSS kind of string, React needs it to be specified as an object containing JavaScript key-value pairs. The keys are the same as the CSS style name, except that they are camel cased. The values are CSS style values.
- Passing Data Using Children
  - Another way to pass data is to use the contents of the HTML-like node of the component. In the child component, this can be accessed via `this.props.children`.
  - Now, instead of passing data as a property to child components, we can embed it as the child contents like `<[child-class-name] ...> [data] </[child-class-name]>`
- Dynamic Composition
  - In this section, we'll generate a set of components from an array to replace the hard-coded components, and include more fields in the table as well.
  - Modify parent component:
    - Use `map()` method to iterate over the array.
    - The header row in the table will now have more columns. Instead of specifying the style for each cell, We can create a class for the table, and use CSS to style the table and each table-cell. This needs to be part of `index.html`. After that, we can remove the inline `style` attribute from all the table-cells and table-headers.
    - Last of all we need to identify each instance with an attribute called `key`. The value of this key has to uniquely identify a row.
  - Modify child component:
    - Remove all the inline `style` attribute
    - add few more columns

## Chapter 2

In this chapter, I learned to use React to render a simple page and use Node.js and Express to serve that page from a web server. I used nvm to install Node.js, then practiced with how to use npm not just to install node packages, but also to customize command-line instructions. I also got familiar with Babel, which allows us to transform JSX into pure JavaScript and to convert JavaScript into a backwards compatible version to support older browsers.

### notes

- Server-Less HelloWorld
  - The React library is available as a JavaScript file that be included in the HTML file using the `<script>` tag.
  - Two scripts should be included in the `<head>` section: (1) the *React core module* that deals with React components; (2) the *ReactDOM module* that converts React components to a DOM that a browser can understand.
  - `React.createElement(type, [props], [...children])` creates a React element. A React element is a JavaScript object that represents what is shown on screen, so it is also called the *virtual DOM*.
  - `ReactDOM.render(element, container[, callback])` transfers React element to the real DOM.
- JSX (JavaScript XML)
  - a markup language used by React to construct an element or an element hierarchy that looks very similar to HTML.
  - Babel compiles JSX into regular JavaScript. It is also available as a JavaScript file.
- Project Setup
  - nvm: node version manager
  - npm: node package manager
  - initialize the project with `npm init` (it actually creates the `package.json` file and sets the characteristics of the project)
  - install packages with `npm install <package>`
- Express
  - Express runs HTTP servers in the Node.js environment. To start using it, import the module using `require` keyword.
  - An Express application is a web server that listens on a specific IP address and port. Multiple applications can be created to listen on different ports.
  - Express gets most of the job done by functions called *middleware*.
    - It takes in HTTP request and response object, responds to requests, or decides to continue with middleware chain by calling the next middleware function.
    - e.g. the built-in `express.static()` function generates a middleware function. It matches the request URL with a file in the directory specified by the parameter. If a file exists, return the contents of the file as the response, if not, chain to the next middleware function.
  - For the application to use the static middleware, we need to mount it with the `use()` method of the application.
  - The `listen()` method of the application starts the server and waits eternally for requests.
  - We can use `node <server-js-file>` command to run the server, or use the `npm start` command after adding the correct entry to the `scripts` section of `package.json`.
- Separate Script File
  - Separate out the JSX and JavaScript and refer to it as an external script.
  - This way, we can keep the HTML as pure HTML and all the script that needs compilation in a separate file.
- JSX Transform
  - Move the transformation of JSX to JavaScript from runtime to build time.
    - First, install required Babel tools (`core`, `cli`, `preset-react`).
    - Then transform JSX into pure JavaScript using `npx babel` command. After this step, we'll see new files with the extension `.js` in the output directory.
    - Finally, make corresponding changes in the html file (change the reference to reflect the new extension, remove the script type specification and the imported runtime transformer library).
- Older Browser Support
  - Install Babel preset called `preset-env`. It can specify the target browsers that we need to support and automatically apply all the transforms and plugins that are required to support those browsers.
  - `.babelrc` is Babel's configuration file that can specify the presets that need to be used. If we contain presets in this file, the `npx babel` command can be run without specifying any presets.
  - Even with Babel's transformation work, code may still not work because of some missing built-ins such as `Array.find()`. *Polyfills* are required to add these new functions’ implementations. Babel provides these polyfills too.
- Automate
  - npm custom commands can be specified in the `scripts` section of `package.json`. These can then be run using `npm run <script>` from the console.
  - To automate transforms, add `"compile": "babel src --out-dir public"`.
  - To automate recompilation upon client-side code changes, add `"start": "nodemon -w server server/server.js"` (requires to install nodemon first).

### troubleshooting

- Listing 2-1 line 10: `<div id="contents">` should be `<div id="content">`.
- To create a default `package.json` using information extracted from the current directory, use the `npm init` command with the `--yes` or `-y` flag.
