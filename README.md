## Chapter 2

### notes

- Server-Less HelloWorld
  - The React library is available as a JavaScript file that be included in the HTML file using the `<script>` tag.
  - Two scripts should be included in the `<head>` section: (1) the *React core module* that deals with React components; (2) the *ReactDOM module* that converts React components to a DOM that a browser can understand.
  - `React.createElement(type, [props], [...children])` creates a React element. A React element is a JavaScript object that represents what is shown on screen, so it is also called the *virtual DOM*.
  - `ReactDOM.render(element, container[, callback])` transfers React element to the real DOM.
